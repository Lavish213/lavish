Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had\nZERO. No inflation, great economy - We\nshould be at least two to three points lower.\nWould save the USA 800 Billion Dollars Per\nYear, plus. What a difference this would\nmake. If things later change to the negative,\nincrease the Rate. | hope Congress really\nworks this very dumb, hardheaded person,\nover.
