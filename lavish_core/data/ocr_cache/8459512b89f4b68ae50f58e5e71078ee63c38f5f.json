LIE @ ) W thestockalley Shoutout to the 99 people who purchased this leap option. It's up nicely today if you bought enough. We have two years left on the contracts. When it comes to deciding whether you should sell or not, it's totally up to you. Never hold an option based on how much you can make in the future; you only hold it once you're up if your financial situation allows it. If not, you take profits and get back in on the dip.
