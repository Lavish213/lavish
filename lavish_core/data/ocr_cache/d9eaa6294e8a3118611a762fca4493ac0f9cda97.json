It’s on you from here. It's impossible to tell you when to sell when you’re in the green because | don’t know what you want to make. | don’t know your goal for that trade, nor do | know how you're thinking. When | traded, all | did was aim for 20%. If | entered a cheap trade, | bought a lot of contracts and sold 80% of them once they were up 20%. If you're trading cautiously and buying a small amount, then your risk reward ratio becomes dangerous. If you're going to take a chance, then take it and go big, so when it pops, you can sell and call it a day. Cheap trades aren't meant to be held for long. You get in and you get out. Anything after that is gambling. 2 days ago @& thestockalley ay Q G) ry",
