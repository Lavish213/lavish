Morning! | haven’t traded during a government
shutdown before, so this is new to me. We will be
learning together during this time. I’ll keep the stop
loss tight on each trade until the shutdown is over.
There hasn’t been a shutdown in seven years, so |
thought they would figure it out before it was too
late. The target is $667, or whenever you’re green
enough. The stop loss is $663.00.
